# **Moviccs**

## Project Overview

Moviccs is an innovative web application developed as a project for the course "Design and Analysis of Algorithms" by Professor. Mary Jane Lima. The primary objective of Moviccs is to provide users with an intuitive and interactive platform to explore various algorithms, including Knapsack, Selection Sort, Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP), and String Matching.

This application empowers users to navigate through different algorithm categories, access detailed explanations, manipulate input parameters, and observe algorithmic behavior in real-time. By providing a hands-on learning experience, Movics aims to enhance understanding and appreciation of these fundamental algorithms.

## Features

### Home Page

Upon launching the application, users are greeted with a user-friendly interface that prominently displays their current location. From warehouse (New Era University), users can generate an order and set the maximum weight limit based on their delivery preferences.

### Knapsack Algorithm

Once an order is generated, users can access essential information such as the address, distance, and knapsack details associated with the order. This section allows users to explore the Knapsack algorithm and witness its application in optimizing resource allocation.

### Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP)

In this section, users can visualize both the shortest and longest paths to reach their delivery destination. The application provides users with the flexibility to choose between these paths based on their preferences and requirements, offering a practical demonstration of the TSP algorithm.

### Selection Sort

The sorting list displays essential information such as the order number, address, and delivery date in an organized manner. This feature ensures efficient order management, enabling users to easily track and plan for timely deliveries.

### String Matching

In this section, users can search for specific addresses. Upon entering their desired address, the system will display results that closely match the user's input, facilitating accurate navigation and ensuring precise delivery destinations.
